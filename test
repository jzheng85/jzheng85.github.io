2024 Year-End Review - Jason Zheng
Summary of Performance
This year marks my first with the GOA team, and I have actively participated in three major projects that leveraged a new technical stack. This experience has allowed me to demonstrate my ability to quickly adapt and lead solutions effectively.

1. Power Platform CoE Team
In the Power Platform Center of Excellence (CoE) team, I have taken on the responsibility for the Service Level Agreement (SLA) solution. My contributions include:

Feature Enhancements: Implemented key features such as import/export configuration, per-project access control, and tracking of remaining SLAs.
Deployment Pipeline: Developed the CoE pipeline to facilitate the deployment of the managed SLA solution across various environments and regions.
2. POP Platform Team
As part of the POP platform team, I contributed to the development of:

Azure API Management Service: Built a robust API management service that serves as a critical component for the Power Platform solutions.
On-Premises Data Gateway Service: Established a seamless connection between the Power Platform (SaaS) and internal HSBC API services hosted on GCP.
Self-Service Onboarding: Designed a self-service onboarding process via Azure Pipelines, significantly reducing the API onboarding lead time and minimizing manual maintenance efforts.
3. Project Sprout API Integration
I led the API integration for Project Sprout, coordinating efforts across six product development streams (PDS). My key contributions included:

Cross-Team Collaboration: Worked closely with the MWS, CBIL, and CUS teams to establish the iB2B pattern for GOA.
Shared Library Development: Created a shared library to manage and promote the reuse of PAPI (Public API) across various forms, enhancing efficiency and consistency.
Individual Development
This year, I focused on my professional growth by working extensively with the Azure Cloud platform. I successfully obtained the Microsoft Azure Administrator Associate certification and plan to pursue the Azure Solutions Architect Expert certification next.

Conclusion
Overall, my first year in the GOA team has been both challenging and rewarding. I am proud of my contributions and eager to continue developing my skills while driving impactful solutions in the upcoming year.
